Welcome to TraceT's documentation!
=======================================

This documentation is designed for users and developers of the TraceT web application.

Research users will find the first three sections most useful as it explains what TraceT is (Introduction), how to use it (Using TraceT) and the methods it uses (Trigger Logic)

Developers or administrators will find the following three sections more useful as it includes how to install and maintain the server (Web Application),
explanations of the software methodologies and layout (Developer Documentation) and the documentation of the TraceT python module (TraceT Package).
